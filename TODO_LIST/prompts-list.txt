TODO_LIST Project - User Prompts Log
=====================================

This file contains all user prompts related to the TODO_LIST subproject.
Each prompt is separated by a line of 73 dashes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Into the subfolder @TODO_LIST/ we will create app:

We will build a TODO application in Django.

The app should be able to do the following:

Create, edit and delete TODOs
Assign due dates
Mark TODOs as resolved
You will only need Python to get started (we also recommend that you use uv).

You don't need to know Python or Django for doing this homework. 

What we needs to focus on is to be completely proffesional with the approach for building this app. We want to have nice structure and we want to use latest, best tools and libraries with up to date versions so context7 should provide us with thoe. 

We need to have a plan to install django and make initial project structure with all necessary files. Then we will continue with implementing the app. Here is the assignment from lector:

Question 1: Install Django
We want to install Django. Ask AI to help you with that.

What's the command you used for that?

There could be multiple ways to do it. Put the one that AI suggested in the homework form.

Question 2: Project and App
Now we need to create a project and an app for that.

Follow the instructions from AI to do it. At some point, you will need to include the app you created in the project.

What's the file you need to edit for that?

settings.py
manage.py
urls.py
wsgi.py
Question 3: Django Models
Let's now proceed to creating models - the mapping from python objects to a relational database.

For the TODO app, which models do we need? Implement them.

What's the next step you need to take?

Run the application
Add the models to the admin panel
Run migrations
Create a makefile
Question 4. TODO Logic
Let's now ask AI to implement the logic for the TODO app. Where do we put it?

views.py
urls.py
admin.py
tests.py
Question 5. Templates
Next step is creating the templates. You will need at least two: the base one and the home one. Let's call them base.html and home.html.

Where do you need to register the directory with the templates?

INSTALLED_APPS in project's settings.py
TEMPLATES['DIRS'] in project's settings.py
TEMPLATES['APP_DIRS'] in project's settings.py
In the app's urls.py
Question 6. Tests
Now let's ask AI to cover our functionality with tests.

Ask it which scenarios we should cover
Make sure they make sense
Let it implement it and run them
Probably it will require a few iterations to make sure that tests pass and evertyhing is working.

What's the command you use for running tests in the terminal?

pytest
python manage.py test
python -m django run_tests
django-admin test 

We should consider all parts, if are necessary and implement only those stuff which is essential. 

Also what is important, we want to have some kind of local DB something like Javas Spring has H2, we should use something like this also in this project.
